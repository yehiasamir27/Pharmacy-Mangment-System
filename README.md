# Pharmacy Management System 💊

A **Java desktop pharmacy management system** that simulates real pharmacy operations using an interactive GUI (not just console logic).

It helps solve the common problem of **manual, error-prone tracking** by organizing pharmacy data into a structured workflow:
- **Login → System actions**
- **Inventory visibility & management**
- **Cleaner data handling with OOP structure**
